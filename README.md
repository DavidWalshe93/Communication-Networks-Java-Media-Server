#Communication Networks Java Media Server

As part of my 4th year studies I created a Java backend server coupled with front end technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a web based media application. 

On the Java backend I used concurrent programming with the use of threads to handle incoming user requests. The server side
could accept both POST and GET requests from the client and respond accordingly. I was able to serve media content on demand such as pictures, music and videos back to the client application. I was also able to demonstrate the use of different streams to serve up HTML and text based content as well as media content to the front end interface. Other areas that were touched upon in this project were File I/O 

On the front end I used HTML5 and the bootstrap framework to create a responsive and attractive looking GUI to demo my completed Java backend server. 

This project was completed in 7 weeks.
